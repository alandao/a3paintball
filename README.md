Paintball gamemode for Arma 3

5v5 Round Based Paintball. 

Players must completely eliminate the opposing team, capture the flag, or at least have the flag closer to their side before the round ends in order for their team to get a point. 

The first team to score up to the point limit wins(default 5). 

No respawns until round is over. 

An unfaithful recreation of ArmA: CWC Realpaintball. Announcer sounds were ripped from CWC Realpaintball. 

Works on local and dedicated servers. Bots are enabled by default and can be disabled in the mission parameters.
